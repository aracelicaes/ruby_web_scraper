<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
## Web Scraper in Ruby
This specific web scraper is built to extract data from The Online Clothing Store [Shasa](https://www.shasa.com/). <br>The Data to be extracted is:
- The Item Name
- The Item Price
- The Item URL

The reason I chose this website, is because I love online shopping. However, Online shopping can be quite annoying sometimes, because it just throws everything at you. So web scraping simplifies that task by allowing me to scrape what I love the most from a clothing store...T-SHIRTS!

Check out the following console output! <3
